    <p> <font color= white size = 4 > 1) Mayank made a bird-bath for his garden
       in the shape of a cylinder with a hemispherical
       depression at one end (see Fig. 13.9). The height of
       the cylinder is 1.45 m and its radius is 30 cm. Find the
       toal surface area of the bird-bath. (Take π = 22/7) <br>
       <img src="3.png" alt="fig 13.9"> <br>
       Solution : Let h be height of the cylinder, and r the
       common radius of the cylinder and hemisphere. <br> Then,
       the total surface area of the bird-bath = CSA of cylinder + CSA of hemisphere <br>
       = 2πrh + 2πr <sup>2</sup> <br>
        = 2π r(h + r) <br>
       = 2 x 22/7 x 30(145+30) <br>
       = 33000 cm2 = 3.3 m <sup>2</sup> <br>

       <br>

2) The decorative block shown in Fig. 13.7 is made of two solids — a cube and a hemisphere. The base of the block is acube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.
Find the total surface area of the block.
(Take π =22/7 ) <br>
<img src="1.png" alt="Fig 13.7"> <br>
Solution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 × (edge)2 = 6 × 5 × 5 cm2
 = 150 cm2. <br>
Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the
surface area. <br>
So, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube – base area of hemisphere
+ CSA of hemisphere <br>
= 150 – πr2  + 2 πr2 = (150 + πr2) cm2 <br>
= 150 + (22/7 x 4.2/2 x 4.2/2) <br>
= (150 + 13.86) cm2 <br>
 = 163.86 cm2 <br>
<br>

 3) A wooden toy rocket is in the shape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as shown in Fig. 13.8. The height of the entire rocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical part is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion has a diameter of 5 cm, while the base
 diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If
 the conical portion is to be painted orange
 and the cylindrical portion yellow, find the
 area of the rocket painted with each of these
 colours. (Take π = 3.14) <br>
 <img src="2.png" alt=""> <br>
 Solution : Denote radius of cone by r, slant
 height of cone by l, height of cone by h, radius
 of cylinder by r′ and height of cylinder by h′. <br>
 Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r′ = 1.5 cm,
 h′ = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and <br>
 l = √ r+h => 6.5 cm <br>
 Here, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but
 the base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the
 cone (a ring) is to be painted. <br>
 So, the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone – base area of the cylinder <br>
 = πrl + πr2 – π(r′)^2 <br>
 = π[(2.5 × 6.5) + (2.5)2 – (1.5)2] cm2 <br>
  = π[20.25] cm2 <br>
  = 3.14 × 20.25 cm <sup>2</sup> <br>
 = 63.585 cm <sup>2</sup> <br>
 Now, the area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder + area of one base of the cylinder <br>
 = 2πr′h′ + π(r′) <sup>2</sup> <br>
 = πr′ (2h′ + r′) <br>
 = (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm <sup>2</sup> <br>
 = 4.71 × 41.5 cm2 <br>
 = 195.465 cm <sup>2</sup>
